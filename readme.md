# Work Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Work Projects Repository** where I showcase a variety of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools that I've created. This repository includes fully functional tools, as well as experimental code and ideas that demonstrate different web development techniques and functionalities.

## Tools Overview

### JSON Editor and Viewer
An interactive web-based tool designed for editing and viewing JSON data dynamically. It features a real-time preview, JSON data manipulation capabilities, and ensures proper character encoding.

- **Live Demo**: [JSON Editor and Viewer](https://berodtm.github.io/work-projects-lbg/json-viewer/)

## Experimental Projects
This section includes various testing code and ideas where I explore new web technologies and coding techniques. These projects might be less polished but offer a glimpse into the development process and experimental approaches.

- **Note**: These projects are for testing and may not always be fully functional.
